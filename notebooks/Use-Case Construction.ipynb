    "The primary goal of our customers is to get their principal money back along with their due interests from the borrowers. Moreover, they also need to gauge the default risk involved, which indicates the probability of the borrower defaulting. This feature called \"Borrower's Credit Risk Score\" will assist the Risk Analytics team in deducing the default risk involved with a particular borrower. In future, they would refrain from lending assets to such high risk prone borrowers. The feature is constructed by analyzing the properties of the call recordings made by the agent with a behaviour analytics perspective. \n",
